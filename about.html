<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Roshan, a passionate and driven individual with a love for learning and sharing knowledge. As a Student, I've always been fascinated by the ways in which technology and innovation can improve our lives and shape our futures.

  Growing up, I was always curious about how things worked and loved taking things apart to figure out their inner mechanics. This curiosity and love for problem-solving led me to pursue a career in freelancer, where I've had the opportunity to work on a wide range of exciting projects and collaborate with talented individuals from all over the world.
  
  Throughout my journey, I've been fortunate to have had the support of amazing mentors, colleagues, and friends who have encouraged me to push beyond my limits and explore new possibilities. I'm grateful for the experiences and lessons I've learned along the way, and I'm excited to share my knowledge and insights with others through this website.
  
  On this site, you'll find a collection of articles, tutorials, and resources on a wide range of topics related to me.

Whether you're a fellow web development or just someone who's curious about the world of web development, I hope you'll find something here that inspires and informs you.
